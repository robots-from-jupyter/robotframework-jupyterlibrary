But users will be installing **Your Code** next to an unknown number of **Other People's Code**, and then write **Their Code**. If`^H^H` When it breaks, they might not be able to tell that it's the subtle interaction between these things. Testing **All the Code** together, _as your user will use it_, gives you greater confidence in your ability to ship."
